   <h1>Airline Reservation System Project Using Java</h1>
    <p>The Airline Reservation System project using Java is a console-based or GUI application designed to manage flight bookings, cancellations, and other related operations efficiently. It can be built using Java's OOP principles, file handling, and database integration for a robust backend.</p>
